# Stencil Component Starter

This is a starter project for building a standalone Web Component using Stencil.

This project was created as an assignment to learn and practice more about Stencial and how this work in the "real world".


## Getting Started

Please follow the steps to run and download the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gu274v0/Stencil-Assignment.git
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
npm test
```

#### Considerations
I found stencil very similar to others front-end Framework and much fun to create encapsulate components
